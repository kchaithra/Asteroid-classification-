# Machine Learning for Asteroid Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a study exploring the application of machine learning algorithms for asteroid detection. The primary focus is on classifying asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous based on various features.

## Abstract

This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms for asteroid detection, focusing on classifying asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous based on various features. Using a dataset containing asteroid properties such as diameter, velocity, and orbit parameters, we preprocess the data and train five different classifiers: `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `SVM`, `KNearestNeighborsClassifier`, and `XGBoost`. Our results demonstrate that `XGBoost` and `Random Forest` classifiers achieve the highest accuracy in identifying hazardous asteroids, with testing accuracies exceeding 99%. The `SVM` classifier also performs well, achieving a testing accuracy of 83.91%. Overall, this study showcases the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in asteroid detection, particularly in classifying hazardous asteroids. Future work could focus on further optimizing the models and incorporating more features to improve classification accuracy, ultimately contributing to space exploration and planetary defense efforts.

## Introduction

Asteroid impacts have been a significant concern for Earth's safety, prompting the need for accurate and efficient methods to predict and prevent potential collisions. While catastrophic asteroid collisions are rare, the consequences of such an event can be devastating, as evidenced by events like the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. Even smaller asteroids can pose a threat, as demonstrated by the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor airburst, which caused significant damage and injuries.

To address this concern, organizations like NASA have been developing methods to detect and deflect asteroids that pose a risk to Earth. One such method is the recent DART mission, which successfully altered the course of an asteroid, demonstrating the feasibility of asteroid deflection. However, before such missions can be carried out, it is essential to identify hazardous asteroids early, allowing for timely intervention.

The aim of this study is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can effectively classify asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous based on the NASA Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) dataset. This project not only contributes to the field of planetary defense but also showcases the potential of machine learning in improving asteroid hazard prediction.

We preprocess the NeoWs dataset to remove outliers and irrelevant features, then train five machine learning models: `Decision Tree`, `Support Vector Machine (SVM)`, `Random Forest`, `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`, and `XGBoost`. These models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to determine their performance in asteroid hazard prediction.
